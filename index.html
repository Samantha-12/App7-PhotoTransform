  Brief Description of Goal of Code:
  The goal of the code is to upload an image onto 1 canvas and then translate that same image onto a second canvas with no red or green intensities shown, only the blue intensities.
  In order to use the javascript debugging console, you first click help on the right of the toolbar at the top of my MacBook Pro. Then search for developer > inspect elements and click on that and the developer tools will appear.
 
  Known Issues:
  One known issue I ran into is getting the text for the second canvas to appear on the second canvas not the first one. I fixed this problem by defining the second canvas with canvas2 and context 2 variables. Another problem I ran into was originally the whole second image was blue pixels. I fixed this by eliminating the code for the data that talked about the blue pixels.
